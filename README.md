This program is a GPS position calculator. The inputs and outputs of this program are as follows:
The user is prompted to firstly enter a file containing other users position and time information. If the user enters a file which does not exist, the program stops running an sends an error message. If he file does exist, the information within the file is scanned line by line and is stored into a structure called other_users. The next step is that the user is prompted to put in their own position and time information. This information is stored in a structure called our_user. The units are assumed to be in meters for position and nonseconds for time. The program then uses the distance formula and calculates the shortest distance between our_user and one of the other_users, and returns which character is the closest.
