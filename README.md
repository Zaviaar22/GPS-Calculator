This program is a GPS position calculator. The inputs and outputs of this program are as follows:
The user is prompted to firstly enter a file containing other users position and time information. If the user enters a file which does not exist, the program stops running and sends an error message. If the file does exist, the information within the file is scanned line by line and is stored into a structure called other_users. The next step is that the user is prompted to put in their own position and time information. This information is stored in a structure called our_user. The units are assumed to be in meters for position and nanoseconds for time. The program then uses the distance formula and calculates the distance between the user and each character within the file. The program finally returns which character is closest to the user, as well as the exact distance between them in meters.
